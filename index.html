        Forecasting the future has been one of humankind’s favorite pastimes.
        We’re usually pretty bad at it, but there’s always been a Cassandra or a
        Delphic oracle, a Sibyl or a Nostradamus willing to make the attempt.
      </p>
      <p>
        We at Project <strong>EDEN</strong> will be that oracle, and we'll build
        our vision using the latest technology and advance material research. No
        longer a mere dream, humans will finally be living in harmony with
        nature and stop our abuse of the planet.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our goal is to upscale the amount of energy to solar panels can create.
        The remainders of the energy will go to the main power gird, providing
        bigger buildings and storing energy in the back-up generators.

        are known to be the most innovative and complex creations of human

        <strong>Urban planning</strong>
        is a technical and political process concerned with the development and
        design of land use and the built environment, including air, water, and
        the infrastructure passing into and out of urban areas, such as
        transportation, communications, and distribution networks. Urban
        planning deals with physical layout of human settlements.

        What's most exciting new technology for transportation? Well, there are
        plenty of candidates! We’ve got the self-­driving car and drones big
        enough to carry people. Elon Musk is getting ready to bore hyperloop
        tunnels. When it comes to moving humans around, the future looks to be
        merging with sci-fi. But from where I stand, the most exciting form of
        transportation technology is more than 100 years old—and it’s probably
        sitting in your garage. It’s the <strong>bicycle</strong>. The future of
        transportation has two thin wheels and handlebars.

          We aim to be 100% <strong>self-sufficient</strong> when it comes to
          energy. Imagine homes whose very building material is salted with
          dormant limestone-producing bacteria, which awaken upon contact with
          moisture and repair any cracks or structural damage. There will be
          “digestion tanks” full of anaerobic bacteria, to dispose of our waste;
          and our homes will produce, store, and reuse their own energy, using
          “microbial fuel cell stacks” and more efficient solar panels to
          generate electricity, and power-banks like the Tesla powerwall to
          store it against future use. Personal homes will be almost fully
          independent of a dangerously overtaxed energy grid.

    <div class="para-cont">
      <p>
        A standard <strong>solar panel</strong> consists of a layer of silicon
        cells, a metal frame, a glass casing and various wiring to allow current
        to flow from the silicon cells. Silicon is a nonmetal with conductive
        properties that allow it to absorb and convert sunlight into
        electricity. When light interacts with a silicon cell, it causes
        electrons to be set into motion, which initiates a flow of electric
        current. This is known as the “photovoltaic effect,” and it describes
        the general functionality of solar panel technology. We aim to provide
        every house with solarpanels and are always searching to create newer
        and better ones. The general photovoltaic process, as described above,
        works through the following steps:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The silicon photovoltaic solar cell absorbs solar radiation</li>
        <li>
          When the sun’s rays interact with the silicon cell, electrons begin to
          move
        </li>
        <li>
          Moving electrons creates a flow of electric current, captured by nodes
          and wiring in the panel
        </li>
        <li>
          Wires feed this direct current (DC) electricity to a solar inverter to
          be converted to alternating current (AC) electricity
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Our goal is to upscale the amount of energy to solar panels can create.
        The remainders of the energy will go to the main power gird, providing
        bigger buildings and storing energy in the back-up generators.

    <h1 class="kris-title">Tidal Energy</h1>
    <div class="para-cont">
      <p>
        The creation of <strong>tidal energy</strong> results from the movement
        of ocean water associated with the rise and fall of tides. The first
        tidal power plant was established in La Rance, France, and the largest
        is in South Korea: the Sihwa Lake Tidal Power Station. Where we are
        based, many waves hit the sea shore and they will provide us with clean
        energy. Tidal stream generators are very similar to wind turbines except
        their below the water surface instead of above or on land. The turbine
        and generator converts the movement of water coming from change in tide,
        the kinetic energy, into electricity. Water is 830 times denser than air
        and therefore can generate electricity at lower speeds than wind
        turbines.
